                How the Application Works
            </h2>

                <h3>
                    Loading the home screen
                </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>localhost:3000 is visited, the node js server processes the GET request of a root path. The server then sends the index.html file to the client.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the browser receives the index.html file, it executes javascript which performs an AJAX request through jquery, to receive a list of item IDs from the server.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Another request is then performed to get the specific data of the first item in this list. When the arrow buttons are used, this list is cycled through, and another request is made to get the data of the current item in the list.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>


                <h3>
                    Adding an Item
                </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the add item button is pressed, the user is directed to a new page.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When the fields are filled out and the submit button is pressed, a POST request is sent to the server containing the entered data.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The server processes this request, inserting the new data into the database</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <li>
                        <p>A request is sent to the server for the data of the current item being updated, and this data is inserted into the fields</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After the user edits these fields and clicks submit, the data is sent to the server in a PUT request</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The database entry is then updated for that item.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The server processes this request and deletes the item from the database</p>

                </ol>

                <h3>

                    <li>
                        <p>When the user enters a name of a product into a field and presses search, this search term is sent to the server as a url parameter</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>This is processed, and the database is queried</p>

                MongoDB
            </h3>

            <p>A document orientated database program that utilises JSON instead of traditional SQL.</p>

        <h2>
            Weaknesses
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Search feature could allow for non-exact matches, returning a list of potential options</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
            Alternatives
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>A frontend javascript library such as react could be used for a more dynamic user experience.</p>
            </li>
